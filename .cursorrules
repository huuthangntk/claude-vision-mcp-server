# MCP Deep Think Protocol

## Critical Rule: Think Before Code

**MANDATORY**: When new information arrives, ALWAYS call the "claude_think" MCP tool BEFORE writing or modifying code.

### New Information Includes:
- Error messages or stack traces
- User requirements or feature requests
- Code review feedback or suggestions
- Performance issues or bottlenecks
- Security alerts or vulnerabilities
- API documentation to integrate
- Database query problems
- User feedback about UX/UI
- Breaking changes in dependencies
- Architectural decisions needed

### Workflow:

1. **NEW INFORMATION ARRIVES** → STOP ⏸️
2. **CALL CLAUDE_THINK TOOL** 🧠
   ```
   Use the claude_think tool to analyze: [THE NEW INFORMATION]
   
   Context: [Current tech stack, constraints, what you know]
   ```
3. **REVIEW INSIGHTS** 👀
   - Understand root cause
   - Consider alternatives
   - Identify pitfalls
   - Note best practices
4. **WRITE BETTER CODE** 💻
   - Implement based on analysis
   - Follow recommended approach
   - Handle edge cases
   - Include error handling
5. **TEST & VERIFY** ✅

### Examples:

**Error Message:**
```
User: Getting "TypeError: Cannot read property 'map' of undefined"

AI: Let me analyze this first.
[Calls claude_think tool with error + context]
[Reviews analysis]
[Implements proper solution with loading states]
```

**New Feature:**
```
User: Add dark mode toggle

AI: Let me understand the requirements first.
[Calls claude_think tool with feature request + codebase context]
[Reviews recommendations]
[Implements with accessibility and animations]
```

**Performance Issue:**
```
User: App is slow, 50+ re-renders

AI: Let me analyze the performance issue.
[Calls claude_think tool with metrics + component structure]
[Identifies root cause]
[Implements Context API solution]
```

### Skip Claude_Think Tool Only For:
- Simple typo fixes
- Trivial text changes  
- Exact copy-paste requests
- Very obvious, simple changes

### Benefits:
✅ Fewer bugs from the start
✅ Better architectural decisions
✅ Identification of edge cases
✅ Following best practices
✅ Faster overall development
✅ Higher code quality
✅ Less revision rounds

### Remember:
> "Measure twice, cut once"
> "Think before coding"  
> "Analysis prevents bugs"

The 20 seconds spent with claude_think saves hours of debugging!
