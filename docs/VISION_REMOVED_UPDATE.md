# ✅ MCP Server Updated - Vision Capabilities Removed

## 🔄 Changes Made

### What Was Removed
- ❌ **analyze_image** tool (multi-perspective image analysis)
- ❌ **describe_image** tool (quick image descriptions)
- ❌ Image processing code and dependencies
- ❌ `maxIterations` configuration parameter
- ❌ File system operations for local images

### What Remains
- ✅ **think** tool - Deep analytical thinking and strategic guidance
- ✅ Full Claude Sonnet 4 integration
- ✅ Docker auto-restart functionality
- ✅ Bun runtime for fast execution
- ✅ Streamlined, focused functionality

## 📝 Rationale

**Why remove vision capabilities?**
- Cursor IDE's `read_file` tool already supports image analysis
- No need for duplicate functionality
- Simpler, more focused MCP server
- Faster execution and smaller codebase
- Reduced API costs (no image tokens)

## ✅ Current Status

### Docker Container
```
✅ Running on port 8080
✅ Using Bun runtime
✅ Container name: claude-vision-mcp-server
✅ Status: Healthy
✅ Configuration: 2 fields (1 required)
```

### MCP Server
```
✅ Name: Claude Deep Think
✅ Version: 1.0.0
✅ Tools: 1 (think)
✅ Built successfully
✅ Pushed to GitHub
```

### Cursor Configuration
```json
{
  "Claude Deep Think (Docker)": {
    "url": "http://localhost:8080/mcp?apiKey=YOUR_KEY&model=claude-sonnet-4-20250514"
  }
}
```

## 🧪 Testing the Think Tool

### **IMPORTANT: Restart Cursor IDE First!**

The configuration has changed, so you **must restart Cursor** for it to recognize the updated server.

### Test Prompt

Open **Cursor Composer Agent** and try:

```
Use the think tool to analyze:

"What are the key considerations when choosing between REST API and GraphQL for a new web application?"

Context: Building a SaaS product with mobile and web clients
```

**Expected Output**: Detailed analysis with pros, cons, trade-offs, and recommendations.

## 📊 Comparison

### Before (3 Tools)
| Tool | Purpose | Tokens |
|------|---------|--------|
| think | Text analysis | ~500-2000 |
| analyze_image | Multi-perspective vision | ~5000-15000 |
| describe_image | Quick vision | ~1000-3000 |

### After (1 Tool)
| Tool | Purpose | Tokens |
|------|---------|--------|
| think | Deep analytical thinking | ~500-2000 |

**Result**: ~80% reduction in complexity, same core analytical capability.

## 🎯 What the Think Tool Does

The `think` tool provides:
- ✅ Deep contextual analysis
- ✅ Strategic recommendations
- ✅ Best practices identification
- ✅ Alternative approach suggestions
- ✅ Problem-solving guidance
- ✅ Architecture planning insights
- ✅ Technical decision support

## 🚀 How to Use

### Step 1: Restart Cursor IDE
**Critical**: Close all Cursor windows and reopen.

### Step 2: Verify Connection
1. Press `Ctrl+Shift+P`
2. Select "Tools & MCP"
3. Look for "**Claude Deep Think (Docker)**"
4. Should show ✅ Connected with **1 tool**

### Step 3: Use in Composer
```
Use the think tool to [your question/problem]

Optional: Add context about your specific situation
```

## 💡 Example Use Cases

### 1. Technical Decisions
```
Use the think tool: Should I use TypeScript or JavaScript for my Next.js project?
Context: Team of 5, building e-commerce platform
```

### 2. Architecture Planning
```
Use the think tool: How should I structure my microservices architecture?
Context: 3 main services, need high availability, PostgreSQL database
```

### 3. Problem Solving
```
Use the think tool: What's the best way to handle real-time notifications?
Context: 50K users, need instant updates, React frontend
```

### 4. Code Review
```
Use the think tool: Review this authentication strategy
Context: Using JWT tokens, concerned about security
```

### 5. Performance Optimization
```
Use the think tool: How can I optimize my database queries?
Context: Slow API responses, complex joins, PostgreSQL
```
