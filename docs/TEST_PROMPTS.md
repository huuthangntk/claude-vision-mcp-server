## üêõ Troubleshooting

If tests fail:

1. **API Key Issues**
   - Verify ANTHROPIC_API_KEY is set correctly

2. **Image Access Issues**
   - For URLs: Check internet connectivity
   - For local files: Verify absolute path
   - Supported formats: JPEG, PNG, GIF, WebP

3. **Timeout Issues**
   - Reduce iteration count (try 3 instead of 7)
   - Check API rate limits
   - Verify network stability

4. **Server Not Found**
   - Restart Cursor IDE
   - Refresh MCP settings
   - Check mcp.json syntax
