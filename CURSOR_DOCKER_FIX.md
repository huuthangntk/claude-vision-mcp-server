# ✅ Cursor + Docker Integration - FIXED!

## 🔧 What Was Wrong

### Issue 1: Wrong Connection Type
**Problem**: Cursor was trying to **execute** the MCP server as a local command using Bun
```json
{
  "command": "bun",
  "args": ["run", "path/to/file"]
}
```

**Solution**: Changed to **HTTP connection** to the Docker container
```json
{
  "url": "http://localhost:8080/mcp?apiKey=..."
}
```

### Issue 2: Missing Configuration Parameters
**Problem**: The MCP server requires `apiKey`, `model`, and `maxIterations` as connection parameters

**Solution**: Passed all required parameters via URL query string

### Issue 3: JSON Syntax Error  
**Problem**: `claude-vision-local` was **outside** the `mcpServers` object

**Solution**: Moved it inside the `mcpServers` object

### Issue 4: Wrong Environment File Encoding
**Problem**: PowerShell created `.env` file with UTF-16 encoding, Docker requires UTF-8

**Solution**: Created file with proper UTF-8 encoding

---

## ✅ What's Been Fixed

### 1. Docker Container
- ✅ Running on port 8080
- ✅ Proper environment variables (.env file)
- ✅ Using Bun runtime
- ✅ Auto-restart enabled
- ✅ Health checks configured

### 2. Cursor Configuration  
- ✅ Connects to Docker container via HTTP
- ✅ All required parameters passed correctly
- ✅ Valid JSON syntax
- ✅ Named "Claude Vision (Docker)" for clarity

### 3. Environment Setup
- ✅ .env file created with UTF-8 encoding
- ✅ ANTHROPIC_API_KEY configured
- ✅ Model and iterations set to defaults

---

## 📋 Final Configuration

### File: `C:\Users\Yomen\.cursor\mcp.json`

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    ...other servers...,
    "Claude Vision (Docker)": {
      "url": "http://localhost:8080/mcp?apiKey=YOUR_KEY&model=claude-sonnet-4-20250514&maxIterations=5"
    }
  }
}
```

### File: `claude-vision-mcp/.env`

```env
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=YOUR_KEY
CLAUDE_MODEL=claude-sonnet-4-20250514
MAX_ITERATIONS=5
```

---

## 🚀 How to Use

### Step 1: Restart Cursor IDE

**Important**: You MUST restart Cursor completely for the configuration changes to take effect.

1. Close all Cursor windows
2. Reopen Cursor
3. Wait 10-15 seconds for all MCP servers to connect

### Step 2: Verify Connection

1. Press `Ctrl+Shift+P`
2. Type "MCP" → Select **"MCP: Open Settings"** or **"Tools & MCP"**
3. Look for **"Claude Vision (Docker)"** in the list
4. It should show ✅ **Connected** with 3 tools:
   - `think` - Deep Think & Analysis
   - `analyze_image` - Multi-Perspective Image Analysis
   - `describe_image` - Quick Image Description

### Step 3: Test the Tools

Open **Composer Agent** and try this prompt:

```
Use the think tool to analyze: What are the pros and cons of using Docker containers for MCP servers?
```

**Expected Result**: The Agent calls the `think` tool and provides a detailed analysis.

## 🧪 3 Complete Test Prompts

### ✅ Test 1: Deep Think Tool

```
Use the think tool to analyze this question:

"I'm building a real-time chat application that needs to support 100,000 concurrent users. 
Should I use WebSockets, Server-Sent Events (SSE), or HTTP polling? 
Consider scalability, browser compatibility, infrastructure costs, and ease of implementation."

Provide a comprehensive analysis with pros, cons, and recommendations.
```

---

### ✅ Test 2: Quick Image Description

```
Use the describe_image tool to analyze this image:

Image source: https://picsum.photos/seed/docker-test-789/800/600
Focus on: overall composition, color palette, and mood

Provide a detailed description of what you see in the image.
```

---

### ✅ Test 3: Multi-Perspective Image Analysis

```
Use the analyze_image tool to perform multi-perspective analysis:

Image source: https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1557821552-17105176677c?w=800
Query: This appears to be a technology or business-related image. Analyze the composition, color psychology, visual hierarchy, mood, technical quality, and potential use cases. What message does this image convey?
Iterations: 5

Provide comprehensive insights from multiple perspectives.
```

## 🔍 Verification Commands

### Check Docker Container

```bash
# Check if container is running
docker ps | grep claude-vision

# Expected output:
# claude-vision-mcp-server   Up X minutes   0.0.0.0:8080->8080/tcp

# Check container logs
docker logs claude-vision-mcp-server --tail 20

# Expected: No ERROR messages, should show "Config schema: 3 fields (1 required)"

# Test HTTP endpoint directly
curl http://localhost:8080/mcp

# Should return MCP server configuration
```

### Check Cursor Integration

1. **MCP Settings**: Ctrl+Shift+P → "Tools & MCP"
   - Should show "Claude Vision (Docker)" as ✅ Connected
   
2. **Available Tools**: Should list 3 tools
   - think
   - analyze_image
   - describe_image

3. **Tool Status**: All tools should be enabled (green toggle)

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Server not connecting"

**Solutions**:
1. Verify Docker container is running: `docker ps | grep claude-vision`
2. Check container logs: `docker logs claude-vision-mcp-server`
3. Restart container: `docker-compose restart`
4. Restart Cursor IDE completely

### Issue: "Config validation failed" errors

**Solution**: This should be fixed now. If you still see these:
1. Check that URL includes all parameters: `apiKey`, `model`, `maxIterations`
2. Verify API key is correct and starts with `sk-ant-`
3. Restart the container: `cd claude-vision-mcp && docker-compose restart`

### Issue: "Container unhealthy"

**Solutions**:
1. Check logs: `docker logs claude-vision-mcp-server --tail 50`
2. Verify .env file exists: `cat claude-vision-mcp/.env`
3. Rebuild container: `cd claude-vision-mcp && docker-compose down && docker-compose up -d --build`

### Issue: "Tools not appearing"

**Solutions**:
1. **Restart Cursor completely** (most common fix)
2. Click "Refresh" button in MCP Settings
3. Wait 20-30 seconds for connection to establish
4. Check that URL in mcp.json is correct: `http://localhost:8080/mcp?...`
