## üéØ How It Works Now

### The Workflow

```
NEW INFORMATION ARRIVES
        ‚Üì
    PAUSE ‚è∏Ô∏è
        ‚Üì
CALL THINK TOOL üß†
        ‚Üì
REVIEW INSIGHTS üëÄ
        ‚Üì
WRITE BETTER CODE üíª
        ‚Üì
TEST & VERIFY ‚úÖ
```

### Example in Practice

**Before:**
```
User: "Getting TypeError: Cannot read property 'map' of undefined"

AI: Let me add optional chaining:
{users?.map(...)}
```
**Problems**: Quick fix, might miss root cause, no loading state

**After:**
```
User: "Getting TypeError: Cannot read property 'map' of undefined"

AI: Let me analyze this first with the think tool.

[Calls think tool]
query: "TypeError: Cannot read property 'map' of undefined"
context: "React component, useState hook, API fetch"

[Think tool analyzes:]
- Root cause: useState<User[]>() has no initial value
- Solution 1: Initialize with []
- Solution 2: Optional chaining
- Solution 3: Loading state pattern (RECOMMENDED)
- Best practice: Proper loading/error states

AI: Based on the analysis, I'll implement the loading state pattern:
[Writes comprehensive solution with loading/error states]
```
**Result**: Better solution, first time!

      "url": "http://localhost:8080/mcp?apiKey=YOUR_API_KEY&model=claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929"
    }
  }
}
```
